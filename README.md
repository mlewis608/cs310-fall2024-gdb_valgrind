# GDB (using the Fraction example) 

- A decent resource: tutorialspoint gdb 
- A better resource:  
  - <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Stopping.html#Stopping> 
  - <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Altering.html#Altering> 
- **To follow this tutorial with the Fraction example, type the bold instructions into your command line** 
- Need -g flag for g++ when compiling/linking to produce debugging information for GDB 
- **$ make** 
- Run GDB with the Fraction program 
- **$ gdb ./use_fractions** 
- Let’s investigate Fraction objects in FractionUser.cpp at line 9. We can do that by setting a breakpoint at that line. 
  - **(gdb) break FractionUser.cpp:9**  **OR**  (gdb) b FractionUser.cpp:9 
- We can also set breakpoints by giving a function name, for example, the command to create a breakpoint at Fraction::reduce is 
  - **(gdb) b Fraction.cpp:Fraction::reduce** 
- Check for the new breakpoints 
  - **(gdb) info break**  **OR**  (gdb) i b 
- Note the first column Num: the value there can be used with delete to remove a breakpoint  
  - **(gdb) delete 1**  **OR** (gdb) d 1 
  - Command will remove the breakpoint for line 9 in FractionUser.cpp 
- Set the breakpoint again 
  - **(gdb) b FractionUser.cpp:9** 
- Note that this breakpoint has Num=3 
- Since we don’t care about the breakpoint we set for Fraction::reduce yet, we can disable the breakpoint 
- **(gdb) disable 2** 
- We can enable it later with  
  - (gdb) enable 2 
- Let’s run the program 
  - **(gdb) run**  **OR**  (gdb) r 
- We can pass in arguments to programs by  
  - (gdb) r <arg0> <arg1> … 
  - The program will run as if it was invoked as ./*progName* <arg0> <arg1> … 
- Note that the program stopped running at line 9. We can inspect our Fraction object f3 by 
  - **(gdb) print f3**  **OR**  (gdb) p f3 
- Let’s go inside the object
  - **(gdb) step**  **OR**  (gdb) s 
- If you lose track of where you are in your code, you can use list to show the surrounding code 
  - **(gdb) list**  **OR**  (gdb) l 
- We don’t really care about what’s happening inside this print statement, so we can skip it with 
  - **(gdb) next**  **OR**  (gdb) n 
  - Next executes until the next line, so we skip the details of operator<<, and it’s simply executed.
- Let’s inspect the parameter and the members 
  - **(gbd) p f2** 
  - **(gbd) p numerator** 
  - **(gdb) p denominator** 
- If we wanted to inspect numerator and denominator with every step, we can save some effort with 
  - **(gdb) display numerator**  **OR**  (gdb) disp numerator 
  - **(gdb) display denominator**  **OR**  (gdb) disp denominator 
- You can see which variables are auto-displayed with 
  - **(gbd) i disp** 
- Note the Num column again. It can be used with undisplay or undisp to remove auto-displayed variables 
  - **(gdb) undisplay 2**  **OR**  (gdb) undisp 2 
  - Command will remove auto-display for denominator 
- You can enable/disable auto-dispove auto-display for denominator with 
  - **(gdb) disable disp 1** 
  - **(gdb) enable disp 1** 
- **Step** again and notice how gdb displays the updated value of numerator 
- **Step** again. GDB prints out the value of numerator again. 
- We can run until the next breakpoint by 
- **(gbd) continue** 
- Exit the debugger with 
  - **(gdb) quit  OR**  (gdb) q 
- Other useful commands 
  - **whatis *variable*** - shows the type of *variable* 
  - **finish** - run until current function completes then pause 
  - **watch *expression*** - set a watchpoint (let’s you stop the program when the value of *expression* so this is extremely helpful) 
- (gdb) watch foo 
  - Stops the program when foo changes value 
- (gdb) watch (myPointer != 0x0) 
  - Stops the program if myPointer becomes nullptr (I hope you can see how useful this is for segmentation faults) 
- Example of watch (crash.cpp) 
- Notice line 15: **ptr = nullptr;** 
- And line 18: **ptr->myMember;** (causes segmentation fault) 
- Compile crash.cpp: **$ g++ -g -std=c++11 crash.cpp -o crash** 
- Run gdb with crash: **$ gdb ./crash**  
- Set breakpoint: **(gdb) b main** 
- Run crash: **(gdb) r** 
- Set watchpoint: **(gdb) watch (ptr != 0x0)** 
- Continue running: **(gdb) c** 
- Notice how the program stops immediately after line 15 because it detected that **ptr** was set to nullptr. 

# Valgrind 

- A good resource:[ http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) 
- See also: <http://es.gnu.org/~aleksander/valgrind/valgrind-memcheck.pdf> 
- Memory leak: memory that was allocated but not released back to the system after use. 
- Run with 
- **$ valgrind *progName args...*** 
- To get more details 
- **$ valgrind --leak-check=full *progName args...*** 
- Leak Summary: 
- **Definitely lost**: program is leaking memory, must fix.  
  - at the end of program execution, there is no pointer to the allocated memory 
- **Indirectly lost**: program is leaking memory, must fix.  
  - at the end of program execution, there is a pointer to the allocated memory, but that pointer is in another directly lost block. 
- **Possibly lost**: valgrind is not sure if this memory is definitely lost or still reachable.  
- at the end of program execution, there is no pointer to the allocated memory, but there is at least one pointer to inside the allocated memory. 
- **Still reachable**: usually not harmful.  
- at the end of program execution, there is at least one pointer to the allocated memory. 
- Also reports invalid reads/writes, meaning writing or reading outside of allocated memory 
  - If we have **int \*arr = new int[5];** 
  - **int temp = arr[6];**   this is reading out of bounds 
  - **arr[-1] = 5;**   this is writing out of bounds 
- Can try valgrind with leak.cpp 
- Notice line 18: **myClass \*ptr1 = new myClass();** 
- And line 19: **myClass \*ptr2 = new myClass(100);** 
- Notice also that there are no **delete** statements in main(). 
- Run valgrind: **$ valgrind ./leak** 
  - Notice how it says we have leaked memory in the summary 
- To get more information on the leak run valgrind again 
  - **$ valgrind --leak-check=full ./leak** 
  - Notice how valgrind reports the where the leaks occurs 
- by … : main (leak.cpp:18) 
- by … : main (leak.cpp:19)
